## Organization Structure

TODO: provide a little more info about what the OpenJS foundation actually does vis-a-vis ESLint.

ESLint is part of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/), a nonprofit organization that supports open-source projects and communities in the JavaScript ecosystem. The OpenJS Foundation provides support and resources to help ensure that projects like ESLint can continue to grow and evolve.
