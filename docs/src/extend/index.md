This guide is intended for those who wish to:

* Contribute code to ESLint
* Create their own rules for ESLint

In order to work with ESLint as a developer, it's recommended that:

* You know JavaScript, since ESLint is written in JavaScript.
* You have some familiarity with Node.js, since ESLint runs on it.
* You're comfortable with command-line programs.
* You understand unit tests and why they're important.

If that sounds like you, then continue reading to get started.
