This page contains a high-level overview of some of the core concepts of ESLint.

## What is ESLint?

ESLint is a configurable JavaScript linter. It's like spell check and autocorrect
for your JavaScript code. It helps you write JavaScript in a consistent style
and fix bugs.

## Configuration Files

An ESLint configuration file is a single place where you put all the configuration
for ESLint your project.

For more information, refer to [Configuration Files](./configuring/configuration-files.md).

## Rules

TODO

For more information, refer to [Rules](../index).

## Plugins

## Formatters

## Integrations

One of the things that makes ESLint such a useful tool is the ecosystem of integrations
that surrounds. These integrations extend the core functionality of ESLint.
For example, many code editors have ESLint extensions that show you the ESLint results
of your code in file so that you don't need to use the ESLint CLI to see linting
results.

For more information, refer to [Integrations](./integrations.md).
For a curated collection of popular ESLint integrations,
see the [awesome-eslint Github repository](https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint).
